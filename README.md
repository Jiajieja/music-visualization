Individual Project of Peter on 2023-2024

Supervisor is Dr.Robert

Added three mp3 files to serve as test audio for this code

The Demo.py 

  Adds easy audio loading and extraction of Chroma features, as well as adding visual triangle mapping hierarchical slices.However, the ability to plot spectral plots had no effect, so it was removed from Demo2.py

Demo2.py 

  Adds audio visualization of 2D triangles and 3D spirals with time tracked landscapes.

Demo3.py 

  Adds WebApp functionality to manually drag the progress bar to see the effect of different audio frequency changes in the visualization. It also implements the ability to change the audio directly on the WebApp to see different audio effects. However, the current problem is that this visualization takes a long time to render, and you need to wait a few     seconds after opening the WebApp for it to show up.
